# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to analyze the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Resources
- Google Colab, Data (50 sets of Amazon Reviews), PySpark, Amazon Web Services (RDS, S3), PostgreSQL, pgAdmin4
